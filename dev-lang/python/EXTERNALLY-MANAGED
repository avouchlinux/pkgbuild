[externally-managed]
 If you wish to install a non-Avouch-packaged Python package,
 create a virtual environment using 'python -m venv path/to/venv'.
 Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip.

 If you wish to install a non-Avouch packaged Python application,
 it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
 virtual environment for you. Make sure you have python-pipx
 installed via pacman.
