Subject: [PATCH] hostmem: don't use mbind() if host-nodes is empty
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since 5.0 QEMU uses hostmem backend for allocating main guest RAM.
The backend however calls mbind() which is typically NOP
in case of default policy/absent host-nodes bitmap.
However when runing in container with black-listed mbind()
syscall, QEMU fails to start with error
 "cannot bind memory to host NUMA nodes: Operation not permitted"
even when user hasn't provided host-nodes to pin to explictly
(which is the case with -m option)

To fix issue, call mbind() only in case when user has provided
host-nodes explicitly (i.e. host_nodes bitmap is not empty).
That should allow to run QEMU in containers with black-listed
mbind() without memory pinning. If QEMU provided memory-pinning
is required user still has to white-list mbind() in container
configuration.
